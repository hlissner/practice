# 097: Find a Writer

> Source: https://www.codeeval.com/open_challenges/97/

You have a set of rows with names of famous writers encoded inside. Each row is divided
into 2 parts by pipe char (|). The first part has a writer's name. The second part is a
"key" to generate a name.

Your goal is to go through each number in the key (numbers are separated by space)
left-to-right. Each number represents a position in the 1st part of a row. This way you
collect a writer's name which you have to output.

## Input sample
