# 014: String permutations

> Source: https://www.codeeval.com/open_challenges/014/

Write a program which prints all the permutations of a string in alphabetical order. We
consider that digits < upper case letters < lower case letters. The sorting should be
performed in ascending order.

## Input sample

Your program should accept a file as its first argument. The file contains input strings,
one per line.

```
hat
abc
Zu6
```

## Output sample

Print to stdout the permutations of the string separated by comma, in alphabetical order.

```
aht,ath,hat,hta,tah,tha
abc,acb,bac,bca,cab,cba
6Zu,6uZ,Z6u,Zu6,u6Z,uZ6
```
