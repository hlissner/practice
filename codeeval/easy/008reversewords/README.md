# 008: Reverse words

> Source: https://www.codeeval.com/open_challenges/008/

Write a program which reverses the words in an input sentence.

## Input sample

The first argument is a file that contains multiple sentences, one per line. Empty lines
are also possible.

```
Hello World
Hello CodeEval
```

## Output sample

Print to stdout each sentence with the reversed words in it, one per line. Empty lines in
the input should be ignored. Ensure that there are no trailing empty spaces in each line
you print.

```
World Hello
CodeEval Hello
```
