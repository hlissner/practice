# 191. Number of 1 Bits

> Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of `1` bits it has
(also known as the Hamming weight).

**For example:**

The 32-bit integer `11` has binary representation `00000000000000000000000000001011`, so
the function should return `3`.
